                <p> JS allows you to make your website interactive. <br>
                    it allows for all the content you created with HTML and styled with CSS to become more engaging. From clickable
                    buttons to log-in options.</p>


                <p>Together with HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one the three core components of the internet. <br>
                 Any website you visit is to use a combination of these three programming language.</p>

            <article>
                <p>JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website. <br> This happens in games,
                    in the behavior of responses when buttons are pressed or with data entry on forms; with dynamic
                    styling; with animation, etc. <br>
                    This article helps you get started with JavaScript and furthers your understanding of what is possible.</p>


                <p>JavaScript itself is relatively compact, yet very flexible. Developers have written a variety of
                    tools on top of the core JavaScript language, unlocking a vast amount of functionality with minimum
                    effort. 
                    <br> These include:</p>


                <ul>
                    <li>Browser Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) built into web browsers, providing
                        functionality such as dynamically creating HTML and setting CSS styles; collecting and
                        manipulating a video stream from a user's webcam, or generating 3D graphics and audio samples.
                    </li>

                    <li>Third-party APIs that allow developers to incorporate functionality in sites from other content.
                        providers, such as Disqus or Facebook.</li>
                    <li>Third-party frameworks and libraries that you can apply to HTML to accelerate the work of
                        building sites and applications.</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>What is the difference between Java and JavaScript?</h2>

            <article>
                <p>When considering Java versus JavaScript, you’ll notice a few key differences. <br>
                    Java is a compiled language, meaning that you write code, then run it through a compiler and create bytecode.
                    The bytecode is then run in a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which is likely the software you have on your
                    computer.  
                    <br> JavaScript is an interpreted language. 
                    <br> It doesn’t get compiled but is interpreted as the
                    script runs. It's commonly used to create interactive websites. You’re reading this right now on a
                    page running JavaScript.

                </p>




                <ul class="JS">
                    <p>What is Java?</p>
                    <li>Java launched with a “Write once, run anywhere” promise. Since its launch, it quickly became
                        very popular for creating client and server-side applications. It has a similar syntax to C and
                        C++. Still, it is easier to understand and has fewer low-level features because that
                        functionality is handled automatically by the compiler and JVM.</li>

                    <p>What is Java used for?</p>
                    <li>Almost any desktop application, mobile application, game, website backend, or server can be
                        created using Java, and it can even run machines. Wikipedia uses Java to execute its queries
                        when you search on their website or app, and it even controls the systems in Mars rovers.
                        Netflix, Google, Twitter, and several other big-name tech companies all use Java in some form to
                        provide their services. </li>

                <p>JavaScript is one of the most popular modern web technologies! As your JavaScript skills grow, your
                    websites will enter a new dimension of power and creativity.</p>

            <h2>Variables</h2>

            <article>
                <p>Variables are containers that store values. You start by declaring a variable with the let
                    keyword, followed by the name you give to the variable:</p>

 
                    <p>E.G:</p>
                    <code>let myVariable;



                        
                    </code>
