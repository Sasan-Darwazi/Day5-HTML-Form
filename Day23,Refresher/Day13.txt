Day13:

display: inline-block brought a new way to create side by side boxes that collapse and wrap properly depending on the available space in the containing element. It makes layouts that were previously accomplished with floats easier to create. No need to clear floats anymore.

Compared to display: inline, the major difference is that inline-block allows to set a width and height on the element. Also, with display: inline, top and bottom margins & paddings are not respected, and with display: inline-block they are.

Now, the difference between display: inline-block and display: block is that, with display: block, a line break happens after the element, so a block element doesnâ€™t sit next to other elements. Here are some visual examples:


Display:
.block;
.inline;
.inline-block;
.flex;
.grid;

.Block:the first dispaly which a property takes is block, which means it take the shapes alike vertical with height and width.
.for elements having block display, you can define height and width.
.block elements always starts on a new line.
.by default it occupies full line space.


.Inline:For elements having inline dispaly, you cannot define height or width.
.it automatically adjust its height and width acc, to content.
.it does not start on a new line.


.Inline-block:
.like inline element it does not start on a new line.
.like block level elemen, height and width can be defined.
